The Support Structure.iam file contains iLogic Rules and iLogic Forms to set and add model states to the Flexible Bracket.ipt.
Set Model State rule and form is meant just for the C Channel 1 Right and Flexible Bracket 1 Right occurrences.
Set All Model States rule and form is meant to control the full assembly. Make sure to unsupress all occurrences before running Set All Model States.
